#Parseq
> ParSeq is a framework that makes it easier to write asynchronous code in Java.

* Parallelization of asynchronous operations (such as IO)
* Serialized execution for non-blocking computation
* Code reuse via task composition
* Simple error propagation and recovery
* Execution tracing and visualization
* Batching of asynchronous operations
* Tasks with retry policy
